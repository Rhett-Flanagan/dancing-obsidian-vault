# Glossary
 This is a list of terms and abbreviations frequently used throughout these notes and what they mean and reference.

## [Alignment](Alignment.md) 
Alignment is your facing on the dancefloor, used to facilitate travel around the room without collision. The linked file goes into more depth on this topic, but this is a quick reference.

### Line of Dance (LoD)
Line of dance refers to the direction that you will travel while dancing. For most travelling dances, this is counter-clockwise around the room.

### Facing, Backing and Pointing
When traveling you will either be **facing** or **backing** the LoD. Facing means the front or your body is towards the LoD, and backing means the back of your body is. Generally a lead faces the LoD, and a follow backs the LoD in ballroom dances.

Sometimes you will see the term **pointing** used, this is for when a foot is in a different alignment to the body.

### Against Line of Dance
When moving against the flow of movement around the room, clockwise around the room.

### Diagonal Center / Diagonal Wall
Diagonal Center and Diagonal Wall refer to the direction the body is facing on the dance floor. This can either be on or against the LoD, as seen in [Alignment](Alignment.md).

## Body Positions
There are several positions that you can take while dancing. This varies by style and dance, as does the specific positioning, so reference the dance's page on it for specifics, this is a general overview.

### Frame
The frame is the hold used in dances. While fairly consistent within a style, each dance has individual nuance to it's frame.

### Closed Position
Partners are connected while facing each other in full frame. In ballroom dances there is more contact, particularly on the legs and waist, while in Latin the contact is primarily on the arms.

### Open Position
Partners are connected primarily through the hands and arms as opposed to closer body contact, and aren't specifically facing each other. This is more common in Latin and Swing, but sometimes used in Ballroom.

### Promenade Position  (PP)
Promenade Position is used when movement of the dance travels in a different direction to normal. 

In ballroom dances, the body and frame is turned into a "V" shape, with the lead's right hip in contact with the follow's left hip, and the lead's left and the follow's right side respectively opening slightly. The intended direction of movement is generally in the direction of the open portion of the "V". Typically head facing will be in the intended direction of movement. 

International Latin styles typically follow a similar form, but involve less or no body contact and the shoulder lines of both partners remain parallel.

### Counter Promenade Position (CPP)
Counter Promenade Position is the inverse of the promenade position, and can be closed or open, and the open side of the "V" is facing the opposite direction. 

### Shadow Position
Shadow is a broad term, referring to when one partner is behind the other. The lead shadow has the lead behind the follow, and the follow shadow has the follow behind the lead. There are several specific variants of this position.
#### Tandem
The lead is directly behind the follow in a shadow position.

#### Varsouvienne
The lead is behind and to the left of the follow, but a right-right and left-left hand hold is held high.

## Footwork
Footwork refers to the movements of the feet in dancing.
### Foot Positions
Sometimes used as shorthand, these positions are taken from ballet.
-  **First Position:** Feet next to each other, heels are together, toes turned out.
- **Second Position:** Feet are side by side, in normal standing position, with heels about one foot's apart
- **Third Position:** One foot is in front of the other, with the heel of the front foot touching the middle of the back foot.
- **Fourth Position:** One foot is about a foot in front of the other foot. Both feet turned out. In "Open Fourth Position", the heels are aligned. In "Closed Fourth Position" the heel of front foot is aligned with toe of back foot.
- **Fifth position:** The heel of front foot is touches the toe of the back foot.

### Footwork Shorthand
The footwork shorthand describes what part of the foot is in contact with the floor.
- Ball: The ball of the foot.
- Ball Flat: The ball of the foot followed by the flat of the foot.
- Flat: The flat of the foot.
- Heel: The heel of the foot. In Standard dances, this is followed by the whole foot.
- Inside Edge: The inside edge of the foot.
- LF: Left foot.
- RF: Right foot.
- Toe: The toe of the foot. In Standard dances, this includes the ball of the foot, but when a foot closes to the other foot from the side, it will close with the toe in contact with the floor.
- Whole Foot: A step with the entire of the foot, no inflection in movement.

### Heel Turn
- First commenced on the ball of the stepping foot, then continued on the heel
- The closing foot is kept parallel throughout
- Weight is transferred on to the foot that has closed as the turn is completed.

### Heel Pull
A type of heel turn.
- The turn to the right is made on the heel of supporting foot,
- The moving foot is pulled back and then to the side of supporting foot (slightly apart)
- Heel first, inside edge of foot, then flat.

## Movement
Movement refers to specific movement within a figure, both in foot and body positioning and transitions.

### Contra Body Movement (CBM)
Contra Body Movement comprises of turning the body (hips to shoulders) against the movement of the legs, e.g. Moving forward with the right foot and the left side of the body, rotating the torso to the left. It is also often followed by [sway](Glossary.md#Sway).

### Sway
Sway refers to the inclination of the body away from the moving foot and toward the inside of the turn. A variant, broken sway inclines the body from the waist up, and sometimes inclines the body toward the direction of movement.

It is helpful to think of sway as stretching the rising side of the rib cage, rather than compressing the other side to avoid a break of body lines at the waist.

### Rise and Fall
In Standard dances, rise and fall refers to elevation and lowering through the feet, legs and body.

### No Foot Rise
Normally when stepping back on the inside of most turns when the heel of supporting foot mains in contact with floor until full weight is on next step. Rise is only in body and legs.

Also of particular note for Viennese waltz as rise and fall can drastically alter momentum in the dance.

### Outside Partner:
Step outside the partner's right side.


### Natural Turn
A turn to the right.

### Reverse Turn
A turn to the left.

### Side Leading
Taking the side body either forward or back with same the moving foot.


## Timing
Timing is specific to a dance, though most music has either 3 or 4 beats to a bar.

### Numbers
The number of the beat within the bar.

### And/&
And or & denotes a half beat of music.

### 'a'
'a' denotes a quarter beat of music.

### Quick
Quick is sometimes used to denote a one beat step. Sometimes it is specific to how you make the step appear, see dance specifics for which is used.

### Slow
Slow is sometimes used to denote a two beat step. Sometimes it is specific to how you make the step appear, see dance specifics for which is used.
