# Competitive Dancing / Dancesport
Competitions are organised through various proficiency levels, with the highest being the world championships, regulated by the World Dance Council (WDC). Most competitions are divided into professional and amateur, though pro-am competitions sometimes also accompany professional competitions. In addition dancesport, under the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) is recognised by the International Olympic Committee as an Olympic Sport.

Each country has their own regulations for dancing, and roughly 30 regularly compete in international competitions, with a further 20 odd countries having membership of the WDC and/or the WSDF, but rarely appearing in international competition.
