# History
The term "ballroom dancing" is derived from the Latin word *ballare*, meaning 'to dance', and a ball-room being a large room specifically designed for such dances. In the past, ballroom dancing was social dancing reserved for the privileged, with folk dance left for the lower cast.

## Early Modern Period
Ballet and ballroom split apart  in the 17th century when professional dancers appeared in the ballet, and ballet left the Court for the stage. Ballet techniques, such as the *turned out* positions of the feet lingered for more than two centuries, past the end of the Victorian era.

### 19th Century
The waltz in it's modern form was rooted in England in about 1812, with 1819 marking the adoption of the waltz form into the sphere of absolute music. Initially the dance was met with opposition due to the closed hold appearing improper, though this stance gradually softened. 

### 20th Century
Modern ballroom has it's roots in the early 20th century, with several shifts happening at a similar time. The first was a shift away from sequence dances towards couples moving independently. This had been pre-figured by the waltz, which had already made this transition. The second was a wave of new popular music, such as jazz, and with dance being tied to music to a large extent, it subsequently lead to a burst of newly invented dances.

A third event was a concerted effort to transform some of the resulting dance crazes into dances teachable to a wider dance public in the U.S. and Europe. Several professionals, such as [Vernon and Irene Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_and_Irene_Castle), [Josephine Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Bradley), and [Victor Silvester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Silvester) analysed, codified, published and taught a number of standard dances. This allowed popular dance to flourish, as it allowed dancers to have some basic movements they could perform with any partner they met. The [Arthur Murray Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Murray), and dance societies such as [The Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing] in America and England respectively were major influences in this movement. Further, this occurred after a period of World War, with the extreme conflict having a considerable effect in dissolving the old customs.

In the 1930s televised dance influenced the U.S. and elsewhere, specifically the sequence dances of [Fred Astaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Astaire) and [Ginger Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Rogers, portraying predominantly social dancing.

## Competitive Dancing / Dancesport
