Welcome to the root of my dancing notes. This is a subvault that I extracted from my monolithic note vault to share with others since I was asked about often.

If you aren't viewing these notes from the webpage version, I recommend downloading [Obsidian](<[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)>), the application these notes were taken in, for a better user experience. If you are viewing this from the webpage and want an offline version, I recommend downloading the vault from the [github](https://github.com/Rhett-Flanagan/dancing-obsidian-vault), it is setup with a plugin that will keep the vault up to date if you have git installed.

This page is the navigational center of my notes on the various forms of dancing I have taken up. They are personal notes built from what I have learned, and are thus not complete, I am not a dance teacher or a professional, haven't compiled notes on dances I don't care for (looking at you Sokkie), steps or dances that I haven't done. The follow side of these notes will also be less comprehensive as I rarely follow, and most it what I have noticed through partners I have danced with.

Should you wish to contribute to the notes in any way, you can get in touch with me and we see about what to add.
