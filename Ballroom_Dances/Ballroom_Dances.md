# Ballroom Dance

Ballroom dance is a set of partner dances with both social and competitive aspects. The competitive side is called Dancesport, and has further divided the ballroom dances into two sections, [[International_Standard]] and American Smooth.

These notes focus on the International Standard section of dance.

## History
The term "ballroom dancing" is derived from the Latin word *ballare*, meaning 'to dance', and a ball-room being a large room specifically designed for such dances. In the past, ballroom dancing was social dancing reserved for the privileged, with folk dance left for the lower cast.

### Early Modern Period
Ballet and ballroom split apart  in the 17th century when professional dancers appeared in the ballet, and ballet left the Court for the stage. Ballet techniques, such as the *turned out* positions of the feet lingered for more than two centuries, past the end of the Victorian era.

### 19th Century
The waltz in it's modern form was rooted in England in about 1812, with 1819[^1].
