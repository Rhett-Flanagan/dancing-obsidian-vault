# Ballroom Dance

Ballroom dance is a set of partner dances with both social and competitive aspects. The competitive side is called Dancesport, and has further divided the ballroom dances into two sections, [[International_Standard]] and American Smooth.

These notes focus on the International Standard section of dance.
