# Ballroom Dance

Ballroom dance is a set of partner dances with both social and competitive aspects. The competitive side is called Dancesport, and has further divided the ballroom dances into two sections, [[International_Standard]] and American Smooth.

These notes focus on the International Standard section of dance.

## History
The term "ballroom dancing" is derived from the Latin word *ballare*, meaning 'to dance', and a ball-room being a large room specifically designed for such dances. In the past, ballroom dancing was social dancing reserved for the privileged, with folk dance left for the lower cast.

### Early Modern Period
Ballet and ballroom split apart  in the 17th century when professional dancers appeared in the ballet, and ballet left the Court for the stage. Ballet techniques, such as the *turned out* positions of the feet lingered for more than two centuries, past the end of the Victorian era.

### 19th Century
The waltz in it's modern form was rooted in England in about 1812, with 1819 marking the adoption of the waltz form into the sphere of absolute music. Initially the dance was met with opposition due to the closed hold appearing improper, though this stance gradually softened. 

### 20th Century
Modern ballroom has it's roots in the early 20th century, with several shifts happening at a similar time. The first was a shift away from sequence dances towards couples moving independently. This had been pre-figured by the waltz, which had already made this transition. The second was a wave of new popular music, such as jazz, and with dance being tied to music to a large extent, it subsequently lead to a burst of newly invented dances.

A third event was a concerted effort to transform some of the resulting dance crazes into dances teachable to a wider dance public in the U.S. and Europe.
